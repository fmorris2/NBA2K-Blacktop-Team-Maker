# NBA2K-Blacktop-Team-Maker
Creates a random team of the specified size (via arguments) to be played in NBA 2K Blacktop.

## Future Considerations
- Change from json file reading to consuming a RESTful API endpoint (if there is a viable one)
- Player validation (ensure the player pool consists only of NBA 2K players)

## Usage
```
python team_maker.py num_teams team_size
Example:
python team_maker.py 2 3
```
